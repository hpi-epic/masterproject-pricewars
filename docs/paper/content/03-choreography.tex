@TODO: how do the services interact, how do we secure some major challenges in short sentences.

No ticks or such, but completely free and dynamic, every merchant can check or update prices at any time -> close to real life (unlike eg http://www.informsrmp2017.com/description-challenge.pdf)

\begin{itemize}
\item event logs, kafka etc
\item fraud / cheating
\item (inter service communication (via REST and connection pools))
\item (where are limits / bottlenecks?)
\end{itemize}
