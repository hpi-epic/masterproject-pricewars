While for the last couple of centuries prices are defined through rule-based actions, more and more companies base their pricing calculations and strategies on technology and data-driven processes. Not only the actual computation of profit and cost is nowadays algorithm driven but also its update and review strategy.
One of the most competitive and advanced fields is the algorithmic trading or high-frequency trading on stock exchanges. But also each one of us experiences nowadays technology driven price calculation on online marketplace like amazon, which we will hereinafter referrer to as dynamic pricing. 

Currently, pricing strategies and algorithms exist but handler of those mechanism lack of the possibility to test them appropriately before releases them into the real world where they can create huge loses \citep{uflacker2016ertragsmanagement} \citep{schlosser2016optimal} \citep{schlosser2016stochastic} \citep{schlosser2016survive}. We picked up the challenge to create such an environment imitating different market situations and therefore testing how pricing strategies react and interact based on influences and against each other.\\

\textbf{Contribution:} In this work, we briefly elaborate our progress of building a distributed and scalable platform to imitate market situations and simulate dynamic pricing algorithms and their effects with potential real word settings.
Therefore, the following Chapter \ref{sec:Architecture} contains a short introduction into the underlying architecture of the platform.
The choreography of different services is described in \ref{sec:Choreography}. Chapter \ref{sec:Behaviors} will provide insights in the already implemented algorithms and their behaviors.
An user facing interface on top of the RESTful API is delineated in \ref{sec:ui} and finally Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this elaboration. \\
