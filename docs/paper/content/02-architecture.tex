Confronted with the challenge of creating a high-performance and expandable infrastructure for simulating a marketplace with different merchants and consumers, we created a microservice architecture allowing the user to scale and add single service ad-hoc and on demand. Each service within our architecture implements one business artifact.


@TODO:

\begin{itemize}
\item add some words to microservice architecture / SOA in general
\item explain our setup
\end{itemize}
