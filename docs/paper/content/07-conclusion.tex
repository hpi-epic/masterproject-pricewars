In this work, we presented a distributed and scalable platform to imitate market situations and simulate dynamic pricing algorithms and their effects with potential real world settings. With this toolkit, handler may be enabled to evaluate their pricing strategies appropriately before releasing them into the real world where they can create huge loses. Simultaneously, students and researchers may now implement and evaluate how pricing strategies react and interact based on influences and against each other.\\
